Hey,

I used to work at a coffee shop/bar/restaurant and as you can imagine we had a LOT of items on our multiple inventories. 

And, to make matters worse, all inventories were in different mediums, some in plain old paper and other in extremely confusing and simple excel sheets.

I tried to help them out by making some improvements to the excel files, but expecting everyone that works for you to know how to use excel is not realistic at all.

So that's were the idea to make this came from, i have no idea if the coffee shop will want to use it but hey, I made it, by myself*. Even if they don't use I learned SO MUCH doing this, and hey, my github was looking very empty anyways.

I'll be posting more projects like this (hopefully more advanced tho)t soon. 

See ya.



*Thanks for helping me along the way Sid <3
